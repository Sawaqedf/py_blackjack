# py_blackjack

This is a blackjack game I created using Python as part of the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu.

This project was created on Expert difficulty: I did not use any of the hints provided by the course. The code for this project was created by only me, except for the ascii art used for the logo of the game.

The computer player in this game is hard-coded to play based on both its cards and the first card of the player, which it can see just as the player can see the first card that the computer has.

Try it out for yourself!
